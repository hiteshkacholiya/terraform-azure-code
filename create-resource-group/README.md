# Create Azure Resource Group

This folder contains the Terraform Code for creating a new Azure Resource Group.

## Files Included
1. main.tf : This file contains the executable code for Terraform
2. variables.tf : This file contains all the variables that will be used by the Terraform code in main.tf
3. outputs.tf : This file will contain all the outputs that are desired from the Terraform execution
4. testVal.tfvars : This is an optional file required only for local executions and provides the values for all variables required by main Terraform code

## Terraform Initialize
The terraform init command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control.

```terraform plan```

## Terraform Plan
The command below performs Terraform Plan. This does not deploy any resources. It create an execution plan. The command below will take values specified in the .tfvars file. If .tfvars is not provided as parameter, Terraform will ask for input during execution.

```terraform plan -var-file="<yourfilename>.tfvars" ```
or 
```terraform plan```

## Terraform Apply
This command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan. If .tfvars is not provided as parameter, Terraform will ask for input during execution.

```terraform apply -var-file="<yourfilename>.tfvars"" ``` or ```terraform apply ```

##### Note: For executing this in VS Code, we will need to setup the local dev environment by installing Azure Terraform extension
